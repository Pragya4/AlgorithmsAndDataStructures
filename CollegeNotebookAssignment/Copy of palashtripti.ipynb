One of my major strengths is to accurately predict a person's potential. Therefore I will be an excellent team player and coordinator. You will find that I am a loyal employee. Though I am in the technical field, I do have some experience and knowledge in business. I believe that you will find me to be the whole package.\n","How do you balance life and work?\tI donot think that I balance my work and life properly. Sometimes thereis heavy workload which donot allow me to spend time with my family. But I do give time to my personal life and family.\n","Tell me about a time you took the lead in a team project. What was the project outcome?\tI have work experience of only 2 years. So, I didn't get a chance to lead a team. But, I was given two freshers when i am just a one year senior to me. My Team lead was confident that i can train them to work in project well and so she gave the job to lead them. I gave my best to teach them stuff and everything is going well. Once i assigned a work to them and asked them to finish it by themselves, they messed up badly. Then our team lead came to the rescue and helped us out. That was the moment i realized the qualities needed for Team lead and started learning from everyone possible on how to become a good leader.\n","How do you balance life and work?\tI most probably am not able to balance life and work but i usely make a time table to create a temp.  balance\n","What do you do if you disagree with your boss?\tIf such a situation arises, I would keep my thoughts in front of him politely and try to understand his point of view as well.

But still I don't lose hope and stick with my ideas and try to explain that in some innovative and real examples. One day, I and my project partners were discussing on project idea. At that time, my idea was good and new but problem was that I don't have any proof to prove that my idea will work very well. But after some days of research, I found actual proof that it is possible to implement and then we all would agreed on that topic. For the newer person, it is natural to have some difficulties in communicating but after some efforts you will surely get confidence to explain it in better way. \n","What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?\tSometimes it happens that I am unable to express what I want to tell because of demotivation from other parties.

Sometimes if I feel that the work will help me to explore something very new and rare thing then I would take the risk.\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tThe biggest challenge would have to be making my project members agree to a certain thing when we are modelling our problem in a certain way and each one wants to do it in their own way. But what I try to do is show them some results and get going in that direction.\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tThe biggest challenge would have to be making my project members agree to a certain thing when we are modelling our problem in a certain way and each one wants to do it in their own way.

Considering the fact that my goal is to contribute to a company with a meaningful mission, I feel that work experience trumps the extra years spent in higher education.\n","Give an example of your creativity.\ti cant have perception to be creative,but some of my thoughts seems to be creative.one such example is the attitude i have towards others,every work others do either positive or negative,i hope there is some reason behind it,taking it in a creative way,may be it doesn't look creative,creativity is defined to me like this.\n","Describe a time when your workload was heavy and how you handled it.\tWhen i was in my high school,and when i had to prepare for my engineering entrance exams and board exams i had to study many hours and work hard to improve my performance.I then decided to priorotise my goals,and i realised that doing things which affect long term results are much important than things which give short term results.I decided to study for my engineering entrance exams more when compared to board exams because college is a place where we spend our crucial period of life,where we learn and get geared up for the career.Though getting good marks in board exams is also important but making it into a good engineering college is more important.\n","\\\n","Thus i was able to make a decission and reduce my workload.\n","Where do you see yourself five years from now?\t5 years from now I hope to see myself in a financially sound environment where I am doing work that interests and challenges me.

Academics always helps us to keep alive the child in us who has to learn, relearn and in the process may discover something that will have a standing impression on society and mankind. Further studies is what I would term as a synonym for \\research\\'.'\n","What are the strategies you think one should have to perform well in such an interview?\tI do not believe in strategies. Interviews are meant to be honest! The interviewer should know who you really are, what your passions and strengths really are. It's about finding your true niche in the company. It's better to be honest and clear. If you can't explain well, take a bit longer and put some effort to maintain clarity. Maintain eye-contact and engage the other person. Finally be confident and live every moment of it. You have earned the interview, be confident and smile.\n","Describe a time when your workload was heavy and how you handled it.\tThe workload during my Second Semester and Summer Vacations 2016 was pretty much heavy. However, I like to be busy nowadays. So I do not think a workload is a pressure, but the means to go forward and learn new things. However, we need to manage the workload due to a daily routine. Time management is the necessary step here. And also, I have this tendency to finish up the work of my interest quickly so as to not mess up the work and team progress.\n","Why shouldn't I hire you?\tIf you have a better plan for me, may be a higher designation. Jokes apart, i don't see any positive reason for not hiring. However it is ultimately your decision and i believe you are best to judge my capabilities.

A person from outside has varied experiences and has higher chances of improving certain aspects of an organisation than a person who has stayed on in an organisation for a long time. An organisation should hence always be open to outside people. \n","Why should you be hired from outside when someone could be promoted within the same organisation?\tI am a consistent performer and hard worker.

Many times we dont need to build things from scratch i.e. working hard instead we can build things on existing things by doing some smart work.\n","What do you do if you disagree with your boss?\tTo disagree is natural and healthy, I believe. We would hardly progress if everyone just agreed with each other and remained passive. But there is a polite, non confrontational way to go about voicing your disagreement. If I had a disagreement with my boss, I would voice it. The manner in which I'd voice is albeit respectful would vary a little depending on the personality of my boss. If he/she were an open, friendly, approachable boss, I would be a little more frank and specific about my disagreement and maybe go so far as to offer alternatives and suggestions.

I cannot imagine myself doing some work that does not interest me, just for the sake of money. I am not saying that money doesn't matter. It does, to some extent. For example, I would be, in few years from now, working for a company that works in the area of my interests (compilers), which pays a decent amount as a salary to me.

Although they are independent things, having existence on their own, smart work can result from hard work. So the major difference is that even though someone works really hard on something, there is necessarily no need that his/her resultant work should be something worth considering smart. Smart work comes as a result of careful and intelligent thinking followed by precise application of those ideas. This might involve a lot of hard work even though it is not necessary. \n","How do you kill your time when you are not working?\tI generally like to talk to my family and friends and roam around and have fun.

I try to explore all the avenues before calling it quits and sometimes it may result in time wasted. I realise that sometimes it's easier to give up because another way exists but I have a tendency to explore everything on a particular approach. I am trying to improve over it by taking it easy on myself if I don't complete a job and switch to next. as I am trying to realise on how wasted efforts are costlier. I have a short temper if work doesn't happen as it was supposed to happen. Earlier I would get worked upon very small things but now I have started practicing meditation to smoothen my transition and be more patient.\n","Give me an example of a time when you had to be quick in coming to a decision. What obstacles did you face?\tWhen I was in 11th my mother had a neurosurgery in which many complications rose. My parents were away and I had my grandfather staying with me. My mother was being transferred to another city where she could be treated well. I had my classes and coaching going on at that time since 11th is a crucial year in academics. I wasn't feeling very well as I am close to my mother and my grades were suffering. So when I got to know the news I checked for tickets on a whim and luckily 2 were empty. Everyone was telling me not to come as it might affect my studies but I wasn't being very fruitful by staying there too. So within that 10 minutes I decided to skip on a test and called up my professors to take the permission and booked a ticket as soon as possible. I feel that it was one of the toughest decisions I had to take as it was between my mental peace and my academics. In the long run I never felt it as a wrong decision even if it was taken in the nick of time.\n","If you could relive the last 10 years of your life, what would you do differently?\tI am happy with what my life has turned out to be.

What happened and why?\tIn my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students.

When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.\n","Describe a decision you made that was a failure.

I also took initiatives to work on harder and more complex modules and that I think helped our team to meet the deadlines and goals at such tough times.\n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tPublic Speaking on Social front, Latest technologies in Technical front and Painting on personal front. \n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tPublic Speaking on Social front, Latest technologies in Technical front and Painting on personal front. \n","What strategies would you use to motivate your team?\tjovial and healthy discussions,giving a chance to everyone to express their views.extending the discussions till the consensus is reached.\n","What strategies would you use to motivate your team?\tjovial and healthy discussions,giving a chance to everyone to express their views.extending the discussions till the consensus is reached.\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tMainitaining good worklife  balance has always been an issue for me\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tMainitaining good worklife  balance has always been an issue for me\n","Have you ever made a mistake?

Given that I'm a bit nervous about talking with new people, I'd love to interact withe them preferably via any social networking site.

Why?\tAbout a few months back, I along with 3 other batch mates attended a hackathon organised by Mercedes Benz. According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers. This worked well and the judges liked our idea and asked to add more feature to enhance the in-car direr experience over the next couple of months.  \n","When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it?

I don't think pressure will affect my performance too much. \n","Explain how would you be an asset to this organisation?\tIf there occur situations when I lose hope or get down, I quickly get back to form and try completing my unfinished work. I try to encourage myself in doing and exploring new things. I am a very good learner, and if something really interests me, I don't leave it. I try to finish all the work in time and get started with new ones.

This way it helps me to perform.\n","How would you be an asset to this organisation?  \tNowadays every one is hardworking, flexible, creative but the most needed thing in any group is conflict management, because no two people on earth can think same way then we can't expect so many people working in a company to think same, do work same way. So there is very high chance of an argument and conflicts ans i will be the first person to take a step to resolve a conflict politely rather than arguing continuously, I will be the first person to say sorry if any thing goes wrong by me rather than blaming others, I can take full responsibility of my work, If i can take praise then i'm also ready to take the beatings.\n","What has been the most stressful situation you have ever found yourself in at work?

I was not that confident enough for taking the drop and also had no motivation initially. Even i suffered from illness in the mid too.

In the end this dedication gave a fruitful reward too.\n","Do you consider yourself successful? Why?\tYes, I consider myself successful. I have an excellent job and able to do justice to my work successfully\n","Why should you be hired from outside when someone could be promoted within the same organisation?\tDepending on the work and work culture one has to take decisions for his/her better future.If someone does not like the work culture of a particular organisation or if somebody don't like the projects of the organisation or his/her profile then it becomes necessary sometimes to change the organisation and choose one which suits him/her better so that he/she could work in freedom and happily do whatever work is given\n","Give an example of how you worked in team.\tDuring my B.tech project we were in team of five members.

In-fact it's been a childhood obsession, after my first encounter with planes. The fact that, I am flying among the clouds with only the sky being the limit is truly fascinating. True, it's got it's own dangers and precautions, but travelling around the world totally changes the perspective. I could cross countries and continents, in matters of hours. And the best part, getting paid for it. Gives it a whole new dimension. Unfortunately, this dream job will always remain a 'dream' to me, thanks to my eyesight being too shortsighted. So, here I am coding and writing software to become one of the many IT guys\n","Give an example of your creativity.\tMy example of creativity is to accept new ideas and support them created by others like me and my friend did a project regarding percentage display of battery using arduino uno which was my friend's creative idea.

How did you do it?\tThe biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. \n","Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. \n","From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. \n","Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered. \n","What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?\tThese two are very much interrelated, as low salary will affect your daily survival and low job satisfaction will end you in depression. So according to me bit of both is required. \n","Why shouldn't I hire you?\tYou shouldn't hire me if you are looking for people who treat their job as 9 to 5 business and don't take their role seriously.\n","What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?\tAccording to me, job satisfaction, definitely, matters more. When we love the work that we do, we can definitely do it better. This in turn will get us accolades and appreciation. This, in my opinion, can never be compared to a high salary.\n","What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?\tAccording to me, job satisfaction, definitely, matters more.

The traditional idea is to save the information, whether or not the user has seen an announcement, on the server in the DB. Given the large number of regular announcements, the large number of registered users and limited server capability, I came up with the idea to store the announcements in the user's device.

Thus, one day before the client meeting, the entire code was all over the place and was throwing exceptions. My manager asked me to do whatever was needed to get things to work. So, I had to communicate with the entire team to rollback to a previous state, but even then we were facing major integration problems. We had to re-integrate everything and finally we succeeded and got a clean error-free build. Communicating with the entire team during such a dire situation and trying to help each other out with whatever was needed really helped me in realizing the true meaning of leadership.\n","Why should you be hired?\tI believe I am the right person for this job.\\\n","I have all the qualifications required and some additional ones too.\\\n","I don't shy away from responsibilities.\\\n","I am a team player and a hard worker.\\\n","Hence, I think I can do justice to this job and help in the development of this organisation.\\\n","\n","Where do you see yourself five years from now?\tI see myself as a more reputed and responsible person , on  a reputed post in some software company .\n","What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?\tI view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.\n","\n","The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on. I'm working on this challenge by purposely making small mistakes in my life so as to develop a better reaction and management for the times when real mistakes do happen.\n","How do you define success and how do you measure upto your own definition? \tSuccess is able to do what you like and be bale to earn a sufficient amount form it.

I wasn't feeling very well as I am close to my mother and my grades were suffering. So when I got to know the news I checked for tickets on a whim and luckily 2 were empty. Everyone was telling me not to come as it might affect my studies but I wasn't being very fruitful by staying there too. So within that 10 minutes I decided to skip on a test and called up my professors to take the permission and booked a ticket as soon as possible.

Hence, we divided the project work among ourselves depending on our interests. 2 of us worked on the technicalities of the project, one on implementation of those technicalities and while rest two of them helped in documentation of the project. But each time we ensured that we discuss with each other about our work during our meetings in order to ensure that everything is going in a right manner.\n","Give an example of how you worked in team.\tI once worked in a team of 5 individuals. 2 of them(including myself) are interested in working on the technicalities of the project while others are not.

One needs to stop the gush of emotions and think rationally.\n","\\\n","2. I'd love to learn to play a flute. It is by far the most soothing experiences i had.

For me one of the aspects of life satisfaction is job satisfaction. So, want to consider that point also. Then one more point I would like to make that I can not live without not doing anything.

We had to write an open book, take home exam and we were in groups of three. We had to stay back during out holidays to complete the exam and one of my teammates refused to do so because she felt homesick. Initially, I was upset and stressed out because we had to complete the exam and there were only two of us and it counted for 50% weightage in a four credit course. That teammate was one of my best friends so that made it all the more difficult. However, I decided to compartmentalize. I decided to take matters into my hands, work hard and attempt to do my best without that teammate. In the end, I was successful and we managed a good grade.\n","Describe a difficult work situation / project and how you overcame it.\tA recent difficult situation I had faced was that of non cooperative team members.

Thus, giving us a very short time to finish the desired task as per new requirement. In spite of all this project delivery met the deadline.\n","Are you a risk taker or do you stay away from risk?\tI never loved taking risks I always wanted things to be straight forward but as the time has passed I have learnt to take risks and believe me I have taken a few very serious risks and one of them is dropping IIT Kharagpur and joining IIIT Bengaluru. I don't know how many people find this decision of dropping IIT a risk but trust me once you are in IIT then leaving it is really very difficult. \n","Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?\tWhen I was working at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I took up a project because it was the only one where an opening was available. The only other alternative was to be benched till another project came. Due to the unavailability of other projects, I took it up although I didn't find the project that interesting. The end result was that I ended up doing a project I wasn't all that excited about. I could have waited a bit longer and got a project of my choice.\n","Why should I take a risk on you?\tI can do the work assigned to me on time.i work hard to achieve the goals set by you.then you would be definitely happy  with my work.you can believe my words because i was  the team lead in our batch in college.i managed to deal with every member of the group and make them work in gentle manner.\n","Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?\tOnce we had to organize an event in our college. It was again a team work. We sat for a week together and planned to organize that event. But due to lack of coordination the event was not successful and we felt very bad. The day of our event there was miss communication and chaos. As a team we failed. It was for the first time, there was such an event and it was not that successful.\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tWhen am in childhood 2 times I got an accident that is the biggest challenge in my life.\n","What has been your best career move so far?\tI think joining IIITB has been my best career decision so far.\n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tI would love to undertake some mentor-ship roles in the long run. \n","Do you consider yourself lucky?\tYes I do.

What happened and why?\tIn my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.\n","Describe a decision you made that was a failure.

I don't think a huge salary alone can keep one satisfied with one's job. If we don't enjoy what we are doing then there is no point in doing what we do and there's no justice done to the work either. \n","How do you balance life and work?\tWell this is a very interesting question. I usually dont carry work related stuffs after the office hours, unless it is life threatening :).  I want to spend quality time with my family after office hours. Weekends are like my stress busters. I will go for an outing with my family. That will help my to get refreshed and motivated to work again on monday :).

Why?\tFor now, I can't say because I am still a student. Yes, I have worked for almost an year but I don't have much work experience. I am working on things, doing projects which I feel should be helpful.\n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tI was always interested in learning music or any musical instruments.\n","I enjoy listening to music so I would like to experience how it feels like making music and make others enjoy my music. \n","For starters, I would like to improve my whistling skills. I would want to whistle a complete song.\n","In long run, I might take up learning guitar or flute. Music has always been a stress-buster for me. Learning a musical instrument has been there in bucket list for a long time.  \n","Are you a self-motivator?\tyes. I motivate myself to be happy and active all the time. I avoid being depressed or worried about anything. The main thing that makes me self-motivated is o make my parents to be proud of their daughter and give the all the happiness that they need, which is what that makes me happy and gives me satisfaction in what I do.\n","What motivates you to do a good job?\tI am not a kind of person who just lives and dies, but I am a kind of person who want to live a great and exemplary life. I want to be a part of good change that is required in the society and the world that remains in history.\n","How would you be an asset to this organisation?  \tI can assure a fruitful effort from my side. I assure proper utilisation of time and skills from my side. The organisation's  growth through my small efforts will be my ultimate goal. \n","How do you define success and how do you measure upto your own definition? \tAccording to me success is a state which a person reaches when he/she has fulfilled their dreams and no longer has to think about what to do next. Since it's a state, you either be in that state or you are not in that state, it is binary. so as per my definition i measure 0, i have not yet reached that state. But i am sure that i am on the right path to reach it.\n","Where do you see yourself five years from now?\tI see myself as a successful woman engineer in the entrepreneurial market. I would like to see myself as very successful person and woman in the world. My wish is to work with Google and develop new things. \n","What has been the most stressful situation you have ever found yourself in at work? How did you handle it?\tThe mot stressful situation I found in my work was when I was deployed into a project and that was using a framework I was not knowing much about. I had to spent lot of time learn that framework and had to concern lot of people working on that framework. That framework was a hybrid of Hibernate framework in Java with some SAP based framework. However, giving time to it and working hard on it, in some time I became handy with those concepts.\n","What do people most often criticize about you?\tThere are quite few things regarding me that most people criticize about.They are listed below.\n","\\\n","1.Patience. (I have a lot of patience.)\n","\\\n","2.Less ego.(Too less.) \n","\\\n","3.Acting silly in few situations.\n","\\\n","4.Not thinking twice before doing few things.\n","\\\n","5.Inability to stick to a particular schedule.(As I told you in the previous answer, I do not like schedules.)\n","\\\n","6.Getting too excited for small things.\n","Tell me about a time when you misjudged a person.\tMany instances for me on this. A Client, wont name, slammed our tech product and heavily criticized it. We made improvements and reached out to him again, only to find out he did that for our own good. Such things happen and these people just know how to react.\n","Give an example of a time you went well out of your way to ensure a project was completed or a customer received the best possible service from you.\tWhen I was working with Cognizant, there were times when there was an increase in the work load because of unanticipated events. This happened more than once when I was working. In such situations, I at a few times, took up additional work, for example, of modifying a piece of software which was used to automate the testing process by the whole team. I also took initiatives to work on harder and more complex modules and that I think helped our team to meet the deadlines and goals at such tough times.\n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tMainitaining good worklife  balance has always been an issue for me\n","When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?\tAbout a few months back, I along with 3 other batch mates attended a hackathon organised by Mercedes Benz. According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers. This worked well and the judges liked our idea and asked to add more feature to enhance the in-car direr experience over the next couple of months.  \n","What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?\tI am not very expressive and can't put thoughts into words, so i have failed in communicating my ideas and explaining it or even getting work done.\n","Where do you see yourself five years from now?\tI see myself as a successful woman engineer in the entrepreneurial market. I would like to see myself as very successful person and woman in the world. My wish is to work with Google and develop new things. \n","Where do you see yourself five years from now?\tI see myself as a successful woman engineer in the entrepreneurial market. I would like to see myself as very successful person and woman in the world. My wish is to work with Google and develop new things. \n","What is the difference between hard work and smart work?\tI would like to give a small example. Consider person A and person B want to get a flowery phone case for themselves, and both of them know that there is no way they can find it online, but is not impossible to find it outside if put in a little effort, as they don't exactly know which shop sells it. Person A tries to go to each and every shop to find that one perfect case for his phone, whereas person B gets a printout of a picture of that case, buys a transparent phone case, puts the picture to it and uses it, as it exactly resembles the case he wanted. Here what person B did was smart work and what person A did was hard work. Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.\n","People say hard work pays off, which is true, but when needed one should be smart enough to get things done easily. There are many situations where only working hard would make one achieve their goal, though. For example, passing an exam. Being smart enough to cheat in a exam to pass is not 'smart work', though you pass the exam. Such work does not help in long term.\n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tI can learn any programming language since now I am very comfortable with the basics thanks to the experience. Also I am eager to learn machine learning models for high dimensional sparse data. Further i am interested in learning about the usage of GPUs for ML.\n","Are you a self-motivator?\tYes, I am. I constantly push myself to new tasks and challenges that I set up for myself. I sometimes need a little push to start off though, but that is very rare. \n","How will your greatest strength help you perform?\tMy greatest strength is my quick learning capability. This helps me to grasp things quickly and thus gives me extra time to do my job more elegantly. This way it helps me to perform.\n","Why should you be hired?\tI am having good knowledge of my field which rich industry experience of live projects.I can work in a team and adapts to the environment very quickly.\n","If you could learn some new skill, what would that be?\tI would love to learn Computer graphics as new skill.As I am very curious about it as I have never learned any graphics related course. \n","What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?\tIdeally, I would of course like both. But yes, I am inclined more towards a job that I would enjoy than a job which pays quite a lot but makes me miserable. I would also take into account how I would fit in the environment at the workplace before making this decision.\n","Explain how would you be an asset to this organisation?\tI'm an M.Tech student who is an allrounder. I specialise in Electronic System Design. Since this organisation builds electronic components I will be able to contribute to the growth of the organisation. I also have good interpersonal skills and I'm a team player. This will help interact with people well and meet the deadlines for projects. All these qualities helped me achieve a lot of awards in my career and I would like to continue the same in this organization.   \n","What has been the greatest disappointment in your life?\tI am just 21 year old, I have not yet faced major disappointments till now. But I was in disappointment the day I realized that I didnt make it to BITS, IIT . As famous quote says Time Heals Everything. I also realized I am happy in my current college and its no more big disappointment. \n","What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?\tIf we look at the present scenario life in the metro cities is too fast and you don't get much time for the things which really matters to you . So for me job satisfaction is more important than salary. If I am working on something that really gives me motivation then that is more important for me.\n","What are your views about further studies?\tI am pursuing M.Tech. I opted for this because I felt the need to fill in the technical gaps, to understand how an Industry works and what Industry expects from graduated like myself. As now I feel my requirements are met. I don't have any motivation for studying further, as of now. In future, may be.\n","If you could relive the last 10 years of your life, what would you do differently?\tIf I could relive the last 10 years of my life, I would instead of focusing just on my academics, I would also like to give time to other things which I didn't. I was a good football player in my childhood and now a days I feel I should have continued playing football. I am also a good swimmer. I would like to to better in sports. Also I think I would spend more time making moments with my family and friends which I would remember for my life. As far as academics is concerned, I would like to practically do what i am learning theoretically. In my B.Tech. I studied a lot by later in my graduation I realized that I lack practical implementations. While I was working in SAP, I felt my practical knowledge could have been better and since then I am more focused on practical implementations rather than just theory.\n"," Why shouldn't I hire you?\tYea, I think you don't have any reason to not hire me. So, please do hire me.\n","Do you regret any decision in your life?\tI only regret my decision of having a bad company during the (second) most crucial phase of my life - the competitive exams preparation and also always looking for some external motivation when none was required. I actually developed a habit of procrastination which I would regret my entire life. My performing at less than 10% of my actual capabilites is the just consequence of that. \n","What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?\tIn B.Tech, when I was doing my minor project. We somehow got a wrong problem statement, and a lot of time was wasted. We didn't had enough time to complete the project. Then with the help of my group members, we were able to deliver it on time.\n","What are the qualities that you seek in your manager?\tI would like my manager to have the quality of hearing and understanding various approaches to a problem rather than giving out their own idea to work on. This would help to approach any matter without much difficulty and getting out the right solution. I would also like them to be understanding situations around them and resolving any difficulties or concerns so that things proceed smoothly and happily which would help in better interactions and team-works. \n","Describe a decision you made that was a failure.

It's a waste of time. Lying is not an option at all. \n","If you could learn some new skill, what would it be?\tI had an idea of trying to learn guitar which I couldnt continue for more than a week.  I did try my best but I felt it was difficult to learn. I would like to try again.\n","How will you make out the best of this job?\tI cannot take my mind off until I have completed what I have assigned.

Similarly I was current working on a creative project regarding solar energy harvesting and pollution monitoring\n","How will you perform under pressure? Will it affect your performance?\tYes, it will definitely affect me when I am under pressure. But from the experiences from my life I am sure that instead of  worrying all the time I will start working on the cause of the problem and then make a list of things that has to be done to rectify things, and start working on it.
